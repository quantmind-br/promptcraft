# Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <500KB initial bundle, <50KB route chunks
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for routes, component-level code splitting
- Caching Strategy: SWR for API data, Service Worker for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <100ms for template operations, <50ms for auth
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling, query optimization, proper indexing
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data, API response caching with 5-minute TTL
