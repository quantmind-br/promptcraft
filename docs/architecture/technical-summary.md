# Technical Summary

PromptCraft employs a hybrid full-stack architecture that preserves the high-performance CLI tool while adding collaborative web capabilities. The system uses FastAPI for the backend API with PostgreSQL for team data, while maintaining file-system based operations for CLI performance. The frontend utilizes Next.js with React for optimal developer experience, featuring real-time synchronization between CLI and web interfaces through WebSocket connections and API polling.

Key integration points include a unified authentication system using JWT tokens, bidirectional template synchronization, and a shared TypeScript interface layer. The infrastructure deploys on Vercel for the frontend with Railway for the backend API, ensuring sub-150ms CLI performance while enabling team collaboration features.
