# Epic 3: Cross-Platform Integration & Distribution

**Epic Goal:** Ensure robust cross-platform functionality with comprehensive clipboard integration, create thorough test coverage for reliability, and prepare the package for easy installation and distribution across all target platforms.

### Story 3.1: Cross-Platform Clipboard Integration

As a user on any operating system,
I want clipboard functionality to work reliably,
so that I can use PromptCraft seamlessly regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pyperclip integration works correctly on Windows (cmd, PowerShell)
2. Clipboard functionality verified on macOS Terminal
3. Linux clipboard support confirmed across major distributions
4. Graceful fallback behavior if clipboard access fails
5. Error message displayed if clipboard unavailable: "⚠️ Clipboard unavailable, use --stdout instead"
6. No platform-specific code paths - pyperclip handles all platform differences
7. Clipboard operations don't block or timeout command execution

### Story 3.2: Comprehensive Test Suite

As a developer,
I want complete test coverage across all functionality,
so that the tool is reliable and regression-free across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests for all core.py functions with pytest
2. CLI integration tests using click.testing.CliRunner
3. File system interaction tests using temporary directories
4. Error condition tests for all custom exceptions
5. Cross-platform path handling tests using pathlib
6. Mock tests for clipboard functionality to avoid dependencies
7. Test coverage above 95% as measured by coverage.py
8. Tests executable via `pytest` command with clear pass/fail reporting

### Story 3.3: Command Performance and Optimization

As a user,
I want extremely fast command execution,
so that the tool doesn't interrupt my development flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cold start execution time under 150ms measured on standard hardware
2. Warm execution (second command) under 100ms
3. File system operations optimized to minimize disk I/O
4. Lazy loading of modules where possible to reduce import time
5. Memory usage remains minimal throughout execution
6. No unnecessary file scanning or directory traversal
7. Performance benchmarking tests included in test suite

### Story 3.4: Package Distribution Preparation

As a user,
I want easy installation through standard Python packaging tools,
so that I can install and update PromptCraft effortlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. `pyproject.toml` configured for setuptools with proper metadata
2. Console script entry point `promptcraft` properly configured
3. Package installable via `pip install .` from source
4. All dependencies correctly specified with appropriate version constraints
5. Package metadata includes description, author, license, keywords
6. `README.md` includes installation instructions and basic usage examples
7. Version number managed in single location (__init__.py or pyproject.toml)

### Story 3.5: Documentation and User Guide

As a user,
I want comprehensive documentation and examples,
so that I can effectively use all features of PromptCraft.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. `README.md` includes complete installation instructions
2. Documentation covers all CLI commands with examples
3. Template creation guide with multiple example scenarios
4. Troubleshooting section addressing common issues
5. Examples show both individual and team usage patterns
6. Template format specification clearly documented
7. Contributing guidelines for future development
