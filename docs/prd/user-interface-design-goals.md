# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
PromptCraft provides a frictionless CLI experience that feels native to developer workflows. The interface prioritizes speed and simplicity, with intuitive command discovery and clear error messaging that guides users toward success.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Slash Command Interface:** Familiar `/command` syntax that mirrors popular tools like Slack and Discord
- **File-Based Configuration:** Leverage developers' existing comfort with file-based configuration and version control
- **Smart Defaults:** Zero-configuration operation with sensible fallbacks and helpful initialization
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Basic functionality works immediately, advanced features discoverable through help and listing

### Core Screens and Views
- **Command Execution View:** Primary interaction showing command processing and success/error feedback
- **Command Listing View:** Organized display of available commands with descriptions and source locations
- **Initialization View:** Setup process creating directory structure and example templates
- **Help Interface:** Comprehensive usage instructions and examples

### Accessibility: None
CLI tool inherently provides screen reader compatibility through standard terminal interfaces.

### Branding
Minimal, professional CLI aesthetic focusing on clarity and speed. Error messages use color coding (red for errors, green for success) following terminal conventions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
Terminal/command line interface supporting Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, and Linux shells (bash, zsh, etc.).
