# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Review this PRD focusing on the CLI user experience design. The tool targets developer workflows with emphasis on speed and simplicity. Please evaluate the interaction patterns, error messaging, and command discovery mechanisms for optimal developer productivity.

### Architect Prompt
This PRD defines PromptCraft, a Python CLI tool for prompt template management. Please enter architecture mode to design the technical implementation following the specified tech stack (Python 3.10+, click, pyperclip, pytest) and non-functional requirements (sub-150ms performance, cross-platform compatibility). Focus on clean modular design enabling the epic-driven development approach outlined in the requirements.
