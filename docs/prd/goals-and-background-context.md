# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable developers to create reusable prompt templates through simple slash commands
- Reduce prompt creation time by 80% (from ~30 seconds to <5 seconds) 
- Achieve cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) with <150ms execution time
- Provide hierarchical command discovery (project overrides global templates)
- Establish foundation for team standardization of AI interactions

### Background Context

PromptCraft addresses the critical inefficiency where developers repeatedly type complex instructions to AI assistants, leading to time waste, inconsistencies across teams, and loss of optimized prompt patterns. The current landscape lacks a universal, AI-agnostic solution for prompt management.

The tool functions as a "prompt compiler" that transforms slash commands into complex prompts using file-based templates, leveraging developer-familiar workflows while enabling both individual productivity and team standardization.
