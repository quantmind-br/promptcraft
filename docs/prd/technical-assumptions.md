# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the complete Python package with standardized `src/` layout for clean packaging and distribution.

### Service Architecture
**Monolithic CLI Application:** Single-binary design with modular internal structure (core logic, CLI interface, exception handling) to maintain fast startup times and simple deployment.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid:** Unit tests for core logic, integration tests for CLI interface using click's CliRunner, and end-to-end tests for file system interactions and cross-platform compatibility.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Python 3.10+ requirement for modern syntax features and performance optimizations
- Setuptools with pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging standards
- Cross-platform file path handling using pathlib for robust file system operations
- Template discovery must respect .gitignore patterns to avoid scanning irrelevant directories
- Error messages must be localized to English with clear, actionable guidance
