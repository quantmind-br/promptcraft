# Project Brief: PromptCraft

## Executive Summary

**PromptCraft** is a Python CLI tool that enables developers to define and use "slash commands" (e.g., `/review`) to generate complex, standardized prompts for AI assistants. The tool acts as a universal prompt preprocessor, storing prompt logic in reusable template files to eliminate repetitive typing and ensure consistency across development teams. This addresses the critical problem of developers wasting time and mental energy on repetitive AI interactions while reducing prompt inconsistencies in team environments.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
- Developers repeatedly type the same complex instructions to AI assistants, leading to fatigue and inefficiency
- Teams lack standardization in AI interactions, resulting in inconsistent prompt quality and outcomes
- Optimized prompts are lost or forgotten over time, requiring rediscovery
- No systematic way to share and reuse proven prompt patterns across team members

### Impact of the Problem
- **Time Waste:** Developers spend significant daily time retyping similar instructions
- **Inconsistency:** Team members use different prompt approaches, leading to variable AI output quality
- **Knowledge Loss:** Effective prompt patterns are not preserved or shared
- **Mental Overhead:** Cognitive load from remembering and typing complex prompt structures

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
Current approaches rely on manual copy-pasting or personal note systems that don't scale, aren't shareable, and lack the dynamic argument injection needed for flexible prompt generation.

### Urgency and Importance
As AI-assisted development becomes ubiquitous, the need for efficient, standardized prompt management becomes critical for maintaining team productivity and code quality.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach
PromptCraft functions as a "prompt compiler" that transforms simple slash commands with arguments into complex, context-aware prompts. Think of it as creating "functions" for prompts - developers define templates once and invoke them efficiently.

### Key Differentiators
- **AI-Agnostic:** Works as a preprocessor for any AI assistant CLI
- **Template-Based:** Uses Markdown files with variable substitution ($ARGUMENTS)
- **Hierarchical Discovery:** Project-level commands override global ones
- **Zero-Configuration:** Works out of the box with simple file conventions
- **Lightning Fast:** <150ms execution time for immediate productivity

### Why This Solution Will Succeed
- Leverages familiar file-based conventions developers already understand
- Minimal learning curve with maximum productivity impact
- Scales from individual use to enterprise team standardization
- Built with Python's robust CLI ecosystem for reliability
