Date: 2025-09-01
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 78/100 (Low-Medium Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Path Traversal Security Risk

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - User input controls command name parameter which constructs file paths
**Impact**: High - Path traversal could expose sensitive files outside intended directories
**Mitigation**:

- Validate and sanitize command_name parameter to prevent "../" sequences
- Use pathlib.resolve() to prevent directory traversal
- Implement whitelist validation for command names (alphanumeric + hyphens only)

**Testing Focus**: Security testing with malicious command names containing path traversal sequences

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

**TECH-001: Path Traversal Security**
- Test command names with "../" sequences
- Test command names with absolute paths
- Test command names with null bytes
- Verify path validation prevents directory traversal
- Test with various malicious input patterns

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**TECH-002: Race Conditions**
- Simulate concurrent access to template files
- Test file system state changes during execution
- Verify proper file locking if needed

**BUS-001: Command Resolution Consistency**
- Test with templates in both local and home directories
- Verify precedence rules are consistent
- Test edge cases with symbolic links

**TECH-003: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Verify path separator handling
- Test with long file paths
- Test with Unicode characters in paths

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

**SEC-001: Error Message Information Disclosure**
- Test error messages don't reveal sensitive paths
- Verify appropriate level of detail in exceptions

**Standard Functional Tests**
- Successful discovery in current directory
- Fallback to home directory
- CommandNotFoundError when not found
- Proper .md filename construction
- Missing directory handling

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Path traversal vulnerability must be mitigated with input validation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-002**: Race conditions can be accepted with proper documentation
- **BUS-001**: Business logic consistency should be verified but not blocking
- **TECH-003**: Cross-platform issues can be addressed through comprehensive testing

### Accepted Risks

- **SEC-001**: Information disclosure through error messages (Low impact, controlled context)
- **TECH-004**: Minor performance impact (Acceptable for CLI tool usage patterns)
- **OPS-001**: Debugging complexity (Mitigated by comprehensive logging)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Error rates for CommandNotFoundError
- Path validation failures (if metrics added)
- Cross-platform compatibility issues
- User reports of unexpected command resolution

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Command template directory structure changes
- New command naming patterns introduced
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in path handling
- Cross-platform compatibility issues reported
- New file system operations added

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: Path Traversal Security Risk
**Root Cause**: Function accepts user-provided command_name and constructs file paths without validation
**Attack Vector**: User could provide "../../../etc/passwd" as command name
**Current Vulnerability**: No input sanitization implemented
**Mitigation Priority**: Critical - implement before merge

### TECH-002: Race Conditions in File Access
**Root Cause**: No file locking or atomic operations for template discovery
**Scenario**: Template file modified/deleted during function execution
**Impact**: Function may return stale path or fail unexpectedly
**Mitigation**: Document limitation, consider file existence check at usage point

### BUS-001: Command Resolution Inconsistency
**Root Cause**: Hierarchical search may behave differently across environments
**Scenario**: Different templates with same name in local vs home directories
**Impact**: User confusion about which template will be used
**Mitigation**: Clear documentation of precedence rules, verbose logging option

### TECH-003: Cross-Platform Path Handling
**Root Cause**: Different file systems have different path limitations
**Scenario**: Windows path length limits, case sensitivity differences
**Impact**: Function may fail on some platforms but not others
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive cross-platform testing, pathlib usage

### SEC-001: Information Disclosure Through Errors
**Root Cause**: Error messages may reveal file system structure
**Scenario**: CommandNotFoundError reveals attempted search paths
**Impact**: Minor information disclosure about system structure
**Mitigation**: Sanitize error messages, limit path information

### TECH-004: Performance Impact
**Root Cause**: File system checks for each command discovery
**Scenario**: Repeated calls in tight loops or high-frequency usage
**Impact**: Slight performance degradation
**Mitigation**: Consider caching if usage patterns warrant it

### OPS-001: Debugging Complexity
**Root Cause**: Multi-location search makes troubleshooting harder
**Scenario**: User reports command not found, unclear which paths were checked
**Impact**: Increased support burden
**Mitigation**: Detailed logging, clear error messages with search paths

## Risk Mitigation Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate (Before Code Review)**
   - Implement input validation for command_name parameter
   - Add path sanitization to prevent directory traversal
   - Create comprehensive test cases for security scenarios

2. **Before Merge**
   - Cross-platform testing on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Performance baseline measurements
   - Documentation of command resolution precedence

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Monitor error rates and patterns
   - Collect user feedback on command resolution behavior
   - Performance monitoring if needed
