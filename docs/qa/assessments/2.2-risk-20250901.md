## Medium Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: Exception Handler Coverage Gap
**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Probability Assessment:** Medium - As the CLI framework expands, new exception types may be introduced that aren't explicitly handled by the current exception hierarchy.

**Impact Assessment:** Medium - Unhandled exceptions would expose Python tracebacks to users, violating AC6 and creating poor user experience.

**Affected Components:**
- `src/promptcraft/main.py` - Main exception handling logic
- `src/promptcraft/core.py` - Source of various exceptions
- User experience - Direct impact on error messaging

**Detection Method:** Code review revealed potential for new exception types from future file system operations, network calls, or template processing enhancements.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Implement comprehensive exception hierarchy analysis
  - Add development-time logging for unhandled exceptions  
  - Create test cases simulating various exception types
  - Ensure generic handler truly catches all exceptions
- **Testing Focus:**
  - Unit tests for each known exception type (CommandNotFoundError, TemplateReadError)
  - Integration tests with mocked unexpected exceptions
  - Edge case testing with filesystem permission errors
  - Unicode handling in error messages
- **Residual Risk:** Low - Generic exception handler provides ultimate fallback

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Mitigation Tests
**Focus:** Exception Coverage and Handling

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Comprehensive Exception Testing**
   - Test all known exception types (CommandNotFoundError, TemplateReadError)  
   - Test generic exception handler with simulated unknown exceptions
   - Test exception handler precedence (specific before generic)
   - Test exception message formatting and color output

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Error handling integration with existing CLI framework
   - Exception propagation from core module to CLI layer
   - Exit code behavior across all error scenarios
   - Performance impact of error handling code paths

3. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Malformed command inputs
   - File system permission errors
   - Unicode characters in error messages
   - Very long file paths in TemplateReadError
   - Network connectivity issues (future-proofing)

### Priority 2: Low Risk Validation Tests
**Focus:** Platform Consistency and User Experience

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Error message rendering on Windows Command Prompt
   - Error message rendering on PowerShell
   - Error message rendering on macOS Terminal
   - Error message rendering on Linux terminals
   - Unicode symbol support across platforms

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Error handling path performance vs. success path performance
   - Ensure <150ms requirement maintained during error conditions
   - Memory usage during exception handling
   - Performance regression testing

3. **User Experience Validation**
   - Error message clarity and actionability
   - Helpful suggestion effectiveness
   - Color coding visibility and accessibility
   - Exit code consistency for scripting use cases

### Priority 3: Standard Functional Tests
**Focus:** Core Functionality Preservation

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Regression Testing**
   - All existing CLI functionality remains intact
   - No breaking changes to successful command execution
   - Clipboard functionality unaffected by error handling
   - Help text and version information still accessible

2. **Unit Test Coverage**
   - Individual error handling functions
   - Message formatting utilities
   - Exit code determination logic
   - Color output formatting

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None (no critical or high risks identified)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001:** Deploy with comprehensive test coverage and generic exception handler fallback
- All other risks have acceptable mitigation strategies

### Accepted Risks
- **OPS-001:** Unicode rendering issues on legacy terminals are acceptable given fallback text remains readable
- **BUS-001:** Error guidance adequacy will be validated through initial user feedback
- **TECH-002:** Performance impact is minimal and within acceptable bounds
- **TECH-003:** Exit code consistency risk is minimal with defined patterns

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- **Error Rate Tracking:** Monitor frequency of different exception types
- **Performance Metrics:** Track CLI response times including error scenarios  
- **User Feedback:** Collect feedback on error message helpfulness
- **Cross-Platform Reports:** Monitor error reporting across different operating systems

### Alert Configuration
- Spike in unhandled exceptions (indicates TECH-001 realization)
- CLI response times exceeding 150ms (indicates TECH-002 realization)  
- User reports of confusing error messages (indicates BUS-001 realization)

## Risk Review Triggers

Schedule risk profile updates when:
- New exception types are added to the codebase
- CLI framework architecture changes significantly  
- New integrations added that could introduce exceptions
- User feedback indicates error message inadequacy
- Performance requirements change
- New operating system support added

## Quality Gate Integration

**Risk-Based Gate Assessment:**
- **No Critical Risks (Score ≥ 9):** ✅ Pass
- **No High Risks (Score = 6):** ✅ Pass  
- **1 Medium Risk (Score = 4):** ✅ Acceptable with mitigation
- **4 Low Risks:** ✅ Standard risk level

**Final Gate Recommendation:** **PASS** ✅

The story demonstrates low overall risk with well-defined mitigation strategies. The single medium risk (TECH-001) is effectively addressed through comprehensive testing and a robust generic exception handler fallback.

## Development Recommendations

### Code Review Focus Areas
1. **Exception Handler Hierarchy:** Ensure specific handlers come before generic handler
2. **Error Message Consistency:** Verify all error messages follow established format with ❌ prefix
3. **Exit Code Logic:** Confirm all error paths result in exit code 1
4. **Performance Impact:** Review try-catch block placement for minimal overhead

### Additional Validation Required
1. **Test Coverage Analysis:** Ensure test coverage includes all identified risk scenarios
2. **Cross-Platform Testing:** Manual validation on Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Baseline error handling performance impact
4. **Documentation Review:** Verify error handling behavior is documented for future maintainers

### Deployment Strategy Recommendations
- **Standard Deployment:** Risk profile supports normal deployment process
- **No Feature Flags Required:** Risk level doesn't warrant feature flagging
- **Standard Rollback:** Normal rollback procedures are sufficient
- **Post-Deployment Validation:** Standard smoke tests plus error scenario validation

**Risk Assessment Complete**  
**Next Action:** Proceed with implementation following risk-based testing strategy  
**Review Frequency:** Re-assess if architecture changes or new exception types are introduced
